Simple and lazy invert color script that can be used anywhere. Codes other than scripts/content.js are (partly) from chrome tutorial with some modification. 
This one does not invert background images, other images (&lt;img&gt;) and &lt;video&gt; tag. If these features are not needed go to https://github.com/lvsl123/chrome-extension-invert
